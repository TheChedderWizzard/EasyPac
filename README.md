# EasyPac
A simple bash script to wrap around Pacman.
It automatically does sudo for you and pacman -S.

# Installing EasyPac
After getting the script, move it to /bin.
Ensure that the script has executable permissions.
To use the command, type "easypac" and then the package

NOTE: EasyPac only does sudo pacman -S, other options for pacman must be done with pacman itself.
